  # Goodplate  
  
  Project developed to practice AI image recognition on food plates.

  It detects what types of food there are on the plate, 
  and list the percentage of how much of each there are on it.

  ## Get Started ðŸš€  
  1. create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` 
  (the credentials are shared officialy by clarifai - I used one of my own to test it)
  2. install dependencies and run the expo project 
  
  ```
  yarn && yarn start
  ```
  
  ## User Flow âœ¨  
  **Given** I am a User
  
  **That** wants to see how my food plate is distributed

  **When** I select an image

  **Then** the app should list if it has _vegetables, meat, rice..._

  They provided a base project that worked on Android,
  I developed it to work on iOS and structure a more "robust code"
